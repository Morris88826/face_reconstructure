# Multi-Faceted Deepfake Dataset: Frame-Level Labeled Synthesis Across Diverse Deepfake Techniques

Our project aims to design a model that reconstructs a person’s face in frontal position from side-view images. 
We believe that leveraging multiple image inputs will enhance the synthesis quality when the source image isn’t of a frontal face. 
This can be done by extracting spatial features of a side view face and estimating the 3D transformation matrix that would transform it into a frontal position. 
Applying the transformation and adding the corresponding color to the features would yield a reconstructed front-facing view of the individual.
